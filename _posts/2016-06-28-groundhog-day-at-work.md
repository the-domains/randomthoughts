# Groundhog Day at work
![How do you deal with free time at work?](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/54ea8353-4bb2-48a8-a07e-302d3b1b7148.jpg)

I just do not know how many hundreds of thousands of people are in the same situation as me, but I have a job that at times requires no input whatsoever from myself. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying my job is easy and requires no effort, far from it, but the burden of free time at work is more arduous than it first appears.

Sometimes my only requirement is to be on site in case anything goes wrong, which often it doesn't. But I cannot leave, I have to be in the vicinity, and sober for that matter. I cannot have a cheeky drink. So my big question is what do other people do to pass the time?

I started out by using the time to progress my career and advance my knowledge in my given industry, and sure enough this went down well, except 10 hours of reading per day is pretty extreme.

I then tried learning a language, another productive use of my time. This lasted quite well, I chose a Spanish course (because it's the only language that's both not shouty or nor smug) and continued to follow the course online. I managed to learn vocabulary and passed all of the little online quizzes, however my learning stopped when I realised I couldn't actually practice actual conversations without somebody else to speak to. So languages went out the window too.

Next up I became a little ambitious. computer programming. although I am a man of a technological background, I have never programmed before and thought it would be quite beneficial to be able to produce my own apps. I followed a lot of online tutorials and all the help out there helped me to produce a few very simple apps, also helping to produce some income on the side. The issue with this is that without a good idea for an app, you have nothing to make.

This brings me to where we currently are, writing this blog. It's difficult to know how to pass spare time when it has its limitations of still being in a work environment. Sometimes it's easy to get stuck in our own thoughts, thinking about the past, or a recent event. Maybe an ex, or the loss of a family member or friend. And that's when it's easy for time to stand still. No matter how much your mind replays events, or you think of things you should have said, or what you actually did say but now regret, the hand on the clock appears to be dead still.

So how do you waste time? Or better yet, how do you distract yourself from really wasting time?
