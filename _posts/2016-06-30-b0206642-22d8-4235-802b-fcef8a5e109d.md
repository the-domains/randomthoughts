When did airports change from being such happy places? I remember the allure of going to the airport and flying on a plane (a desire of man, to defy gravity since the dawn of creation) and to land in a new and foreign place, extinct of work and responsibility and anything related to the country you escaped. 

It is impossible to go on a holiday and not get excited about it before hand, the holiday officially begins at the airport. so why then do I see hundreds of people with the inability to smile. now I know a percentage of people are on business trips, but I fail to believe that percentage is 99.9% of passengers through this airport. 

That said, airports do not make it simple. For a start you have to navigate through the high volume of people that grab a trolley to push around their one suitcase which is on wheels, dodge the over excited kids which have clearly been feasting on chocolate since they got up at 4am, and yet still try and rush to beat the huge family about to win this race to reach the back of the check in queue. 

sometimes there is no possible way to speak to an attendant when checking in. Instead it is a job left to you, to check yourself in using one of the self service machines which then print a tag, which you attach to your luggage and then drop it off yourself (seriously, soon we will be carrying the luggage to the hold ourselves). 

This isn't the most painful part of the process. Next up is security. This is the worst for regular travellers. If you know the system, you can walk straight through. However no other passenger that day appears to ever have flown, instead forgetting about belts, or jewellery or hidden piercings. Forgetting about the little bottle of perfume left in the bottom of the bag, or that bottle of water. It seems suddenly every passenger is capable of wasting everybody's time.

Then finally, navigate through the world's shittiest 'yellow brick road' which weaves it's way through the duty free shop with no possible bypass or shortcut. I've yet to figure out how these are still in business as the Internet makes these products available to everybody for cheaper, and contains stuff we actually want!

If you're at a larger airport you may be able to find a selection of shops or bars that you would agree to spend your time in, a smaller airport though and you are screwed. It is every travellers perogative to find sanctuary in a decent bar until boarding time. Boarding time proves to be even more hasslesome (yes it's a word!). There are people that insist on speedy boarding even though they are in aisle seats and have to get up again when the window seat guests arrive. There are people that somehow have managed to purchase half of the duty free as well as their masses of carry on luggage and then spend at least 15 minutes trying to find space in the overhead locker whilst holding up the rest of the passengers. There will inevitably be a few pushy people that despite being blocked in front will still continue to try and push you forward, regardless of personal space being invaded. 

I think I have just managed to answer my own question by writing this. Airports are bloody stressful, regardless why you are travelling it's just no longer simple. Maybe I'll just stay at home.
